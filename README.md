## 1. Gravity

A work-in-progress simulation to visualise the effect of the gravity of a star(s) on a cloud of test masses. If multiple stars are passed, they exert a Newtonian gravitational force on each other. Stars can include non-star objects to simulate a fully-interacting system, however their name arises from the original intent of the simulations.

Below is an example animation created with the visualiser class `gravity.visualisation.Plotter` for a set of 6 test masses simulated with a single star using `gravity.newtonian.dynamics.Dynamics`.
